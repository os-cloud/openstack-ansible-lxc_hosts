# TODO(odyssey4me)
#  Ansible 1.9x only actually checks whether there's a local file - it never
#  checks whether the local file matches the given sha256sum. Ansible 2.x
#  fixes this, so once we move to Ansible 2.x we can pass this a sha256sum
#  which will:
#       a) allow us to remove force: yes
#       b) allow the module to calculate the checksum of dest file which would
#          result in file being downloaded only if provided and dest sha256sum
#          checksums differ
# Currently 'force:yes' will always download the file, then do a sha256sum
# comparison between the downloaded file and the existing file, then replace
# the existing file if it doesn't match.
