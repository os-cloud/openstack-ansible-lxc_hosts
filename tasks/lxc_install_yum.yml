# NOTE: Existing CentOS environments may not have the COPR repo priority set
#       higher than the default. The following task ensures that existing
#       deployments have their priority adjusted for the COPR repository.
# TODO(mhayden): The ini_file module is required here since the yum_repository
#                module can only do add/remove operations, not edits.
#                Ansible bug: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/22362
