features:
  - The lxcbr0 interface is now managed by systemd-networkd.
    this has been done to allow us to unify our container
    network capabilities across distributions without carrying
    distro specific configs. This also removes the need to run
    dnsmasq, manage the process and its specific user, and
    simplifies the how the lxc network is started and attached
    to across reboots.
  - Several variables were removed from the lxc_host role.
    ``lxc_net_bridge_port``, ``lxc_net_nat``,
    ``lxc_net_dhcp_config``, ``lxc_net_dnsmasq_user``,
    ``lxc_net_domain``, ``lxc_net6_nat``. ``lxc_net_manage_iptables``
    These options were removed because they no longer have any
    effect with the move to systemd-{networkd,firewalld}. Specific
    network configuration overrides are now handled through the
    use of ``config_template`` using the following options --
    ``lxc_network_default_link``, ``lxc_network_dummy_netdev``,
    ``lxc_network_dummy_network``, ``lxc_network_lxcbr_netdev``,
    ``lxc_network_lxcbr_network``.
