features:
  - The option ``lxc_hosts_container_image_url`` has been added allowing
    deployers to define their base image url to whatever it needs to be
    removing the requirement for operators to maintain an internal LXC
    index in the event they want to host a private repository.

deprecations:
  - The variable ``lxc_image_cache_server_mirrors`` has been deprecated
    in the "lxc_hosts" role. This option has been replaced by the static
    variable ``lxc_hosts_container_image_url``.
  - The variable ``-lxc_image_cache_server`` has been deprecated in the
    ``lxc_hosts`` role. This option has been replaced by the static
    variable ``lxc_hosts_container_image_url``.
other:
  - The use of **images.linuxcontainers.org** is no longer required. While
    the images provided by that build system are perfectly functional they
    have been less than optimal in a lot ways for a very long time. The
    ``lxc_hosts`` role will now pull a base image from the upstream distro
    being deployed. If a deployer wishes to continue using the images from
    **images.linuxcontainers.org** they are welcome to but it is no longer
    forced.
